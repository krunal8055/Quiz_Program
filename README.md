Implement a Student class with the following fields, constructors and methods:

Fields: 

name;

totalScore;

numberOfQuizzes;

Constructors:

public Student(String name, double score) 

public Student(double score, String name) 

public Student(String name)

Methods:

public String getName()

public double getAverage() //this should return zero if no quiz has been taken.

public double getTotalScore()

public void addQuiz(double score)

public void printStudent() //this should print the student’s name and average score 

public String toString()

Write an application TestStudent that reads a student name and use the Student class to create a Student object. 
Then read the scores of the student in three quizzes and add each to the totalScore of the student using addQuiz() method and print the student object.
( Note: Make use of this key word wherever it can be used ).
